About POD Web View
------------------

POD Web View lets you see a quick preview of your POD file as it will appear on
[CPAN](http://cpan.org/), [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org) and [GitHub](https://github.com).

The application is built with free and open source software: the awesome
Perl Dancer web framework, the Pod::Simple::HTML module, the Twitter Bootstrap front-end framework, and the Ace code editor. The source code is available on GitHub.
